Diversity culture : example 63 nationaltiy

// introduction

I am currently working as Front end developer with VMware having Bachelor's degree in computer science.

I possess a total of 5 yr of experience working with companies of diversified background backgrounds ranging from startups to big corporate such as Paytm and VMware.
In Paytm, I worked on mini-apps which are bascially hybrids apps which combine the functionality of native apps to the flexibility of mobile websites.  
Paytm online payment solutions to over 100 million users across India.
In Vmware I am working on vRelaze network software.
vRealize Network Insight is a network monitoring tool that helps s organisation building a highly secure and reliable network of data centers functioning in an hybrid and multi cloud enviroment.
And currently I am working on code coverage analysis tool with the help of Sonarcube.

As bit of myself, I like frontend because every decision and optimazation you make the user will actually see.
I also love to play football and cricket and was also a football team captain of the college.

// Why leaving

Personallyis a great company to work for and I'm feel proud and lucky to work with a folks from my team. But the problem is that here quater release cycle from last 7-8 months due to which we speed less time on feature rollout than mantaining the product. I think I am that career where I should challeng myself enough and solve more challenging problems.

// Why Personia

I have experience working in both startup and coperate company . I think I interesed lie more towards the startup culture whuch very talented engineers from all over the world.
So we can learn from others, share the project vision, ideas and be on the edge of front-end technologies.

And last but not least it's company values, customer responsiblity, team spirit, transparency, ownership, social responsiblity and fun.

//What are the most interesting projects you’ve worked on? How are they relevant to the <name> environment?

I think mini-apps , as I was one of the core team from UI side to implement the mini-apps on paytm app which alredy had 100M+ user download both for android and IOS.

Challenge:  
traditional mobile apps such as maintaining multiple codebases across platforms (iOS, Android or Web), costly user acquisition and requirement of app release and then a waiting period for user adoption for any change made in the app

Action: H5 alibaba technolory which provide native JS bridge to intract
Technical Challenge:
New technology ,no resource online
shipping small file apps that should work both on android and IOS
should support small devices too.
intracting with JS bridge for native functionality

Result
Launching as a Mini Apps gives you freedom from all these hassles: implying lesser development/testing and maintenance costs which help you reach millions of Paytm users.
INCREASED user interaction by 20%
easy

// What are some of the biggest professional challenges you’ve faced, and how have you overcome them?

The first version the application was written ten years ago and consisted of some backbone Jquery and somewhat react js was used for new feature we wanted to update the front-end which refracroting the old code and architecture of backbone with new arch of react js while mainting quality of the application.

Action
I was aligned with one of the senior. We both stucture the rodmap how we took each of task for serveral next release.
We've decided that we split the whole application into several modules and I need to create the sharable architecture for the app in order to pass for others front-end engineers.
As I have'nt worked on backbone before , so its challenge for me to learn and understand the legacy code.
There was so many cross-team communication, so my idea was to form the front-end unit in our projectfrom ES team to UX team .
Leason learned

- It's almost impossible to build cool stuff alone
- You need to believe your team, listen them and share ideas
- Splitting the feature set and extracting the most important one is crucial

Result

1. Application total bundle size was decreased by 40%
2. Client error rate in the browser was decreased from 10% to 0.1%
3. Average page speed loading decreased from 6 seconds to 3.5, this is almost 50% network performance boost
4. New Architecture and modern toolset allowed us to implement features sets very quickly

// Tell me about a time you not only met your goals, but exceeded expectations.
During one of my feature release, I have provide support of table widget with a suport of pagination, column sorting and filerting which show various newtork point to users.
I show this requirement as the one which we come in future case also.
So instead of developing the featue for my usecase.
i build the dynamic table with supoort of configurable columns , sorting , filter and pagination.
In future we someone has to build the same tablem they pass the api url to table for fetching the records and coolumn config , all the things will work smothly

Result
reduced developmemt time when similar use case occur
less code to maintain and test
less bundle size decrease page load time

//## 9. Describe a situation where you had to face a particularly challenging situation while working on a project and what you did to overcome it

Server Side Events

discuss use case first

Challenges
Was working on the SSE when decieded to open connection for each tan due to this were consuming so we have to come with better and scalable solution while sycning all the tabs

// Describe a situatuion where others you were working with on a project disagreed with your ideas. What did you do?

### Problem

We're planning to integrate a new feature set for our application. But our app had a legacy part, which nobody wanted to touch. Although, we could proceed with a feature set, I thought about refactoring the architecture of this part, in order to simplify further features integration. This would slow the team in short terms, but could give us a huge benefits in a long run. My team didn't agree with me.

### Action

I've made a diagram of current application architecture, explained which parts we were going to touch and why it was important to refactor it, before we made new features. I also showed the benefits of it, give a team estimation and took responsibility for this part. The team agreed to go with my approach

### Result

With a new module architecture, it became much easier to integrate new stuff inside the app. The whole module become consistent with the rest of the app. Although, I had to spend about 3 weeks to get the job done. This allowed us to integrate new features much faster, then we could before and in a long run, we saved plenty of time.

Presentation skill: I pandemic i have giving a lot of presentation, and what I feel that this the area I have to improve more.
