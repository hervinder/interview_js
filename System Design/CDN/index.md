Content delivery networks (CDNs) improve site performance by using a distributed network of servers to deliver resources to users. Because CDNs reduce server load, they reduce server costs and are well-suited to handling traffic spikes

Use a CDN:

- CDNs deliver resources quickly, reduce load on the origin server, and are helpful for dealing with traffic spikes.
- Cache content as aggressively as possible: Both static and dynamic content can and should be cached - albeit for varying durations.
