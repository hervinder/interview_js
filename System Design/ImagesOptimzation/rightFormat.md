Choose the right format

- Vector graphics use lines, points, and polygons to represent an image

  - Used for logos, text, or icons.
  - Deliver sharp results at every resolution and zoom setting, which makes them an ideal format for **high-resolution** screens and assets that need to be displayed at varying sizes.

- Raster graphics represent an image by encoding the individual values of each pixel within a rectangular grid.

  - Used for PNG, JPEG, or WebP.
  - do not have the same nice properties of being resolution or zoom independent.
  - may need to save multiple versions of a raster image at various resolutions to deliver the optimal experience to your users.

  PNG

  - need to preserve fine detail with highest resolution
  - it will produce the highest quality image
  - file size larger
  - good for high resolution

Jpeg

- optimizing a photo, screenshot, or a similar image asset
- file size smaller
- not good for high resolution

Webp

- Images are smaller than their JPEG and PNG counterparts—usually on the magnitude of a 25–35% reduction in filesize.

- This decreases page sizes and improves performance.

- all modern browser support
